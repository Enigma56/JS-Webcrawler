# Webcrawler
## Overview
This was created by following a guided project from [boot.dev](https://boot.dev). This project taught me how to use javascript in conjunction witht the DOM to crawl a webpage and count links to other webpages given a base URL

## How to use
1. Install npm and node on your machine (make sure node is version 21 or higher)
2. `npm install` all of the dependencies in the project
3. Clone and navigate into the project
4. run `npm start <url>` where url is the home page of the website you want to crawl

Voila! The ouput is a count of each time a URL is references as it crawls through the website you provided. This project can be extended in numerous different ways such as: to extract information from an html body; to perform analysis on a website; or to pull any other type of tag from a website html document
